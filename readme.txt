A simple javascript/HTLM5 (only) DICOM web viewer. I'm a beginner at both javascript and HTML5 so any 
coding/implementation comments are welcome.

For now works only with local files. 

 * Firefox: straight out of the box,
 * Google Chrome: launch it with the command line option: --allow-file-access-from-files.
